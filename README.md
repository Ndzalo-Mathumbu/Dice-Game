# 🎲 Dice Game

> A classic 2‑player dice game I built from scratch in vanilla JavaScript, following along with Jonas Schmedtmann’s course — to master DOM manipulation, event-driven logic, and clean code structure.

---

## 🕹️ What it does

- Two players take turns rolling a single die.
- Each roll adds to the *current* score — unless you roll a 1 (then you lose the current round’s points and it’s the other player’s turn).
- At any point, you can **hold** to bank your current round score into your *total* score.
- First player to reach 100 wins!

All game logic, UI updates, and state management are handled entirely in vanilla JavaScript.
